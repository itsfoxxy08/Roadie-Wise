🚀 Getting Started & Setup
To get Roadie-Wise running on your local machine, please follow these steps carefully.

1. File Placement (Crucial!)
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Before running, you MUST have all the project files (images, datasets, helper scripts, etc.) in the exact same directory as the main Python file (main.py).

2. Install Required Modules
Open your command prompt (CMD), PowerShell, or Terminal and run the following commands one by one. This will install all the necessary Python libraries for the project to function correctly.

# To install the game engine
pip install pygame

# To connect to the MySQL database
pip install mysql-connector-python

# For data handling and analysis
pip install pandas

# For creating plots and graphs
pip install matplotlib

# For enhanced data visualization
pip install seaborn

# For image processing tasks
pip install Pillow

3. Run the Application
Once all the libraries are installed and the files are correctly placed, you can run the project by executing the main Python script:

python your_main_file_name.py

Now you're all set! Enjoy the experience and remember to always drive safely. 🎉
